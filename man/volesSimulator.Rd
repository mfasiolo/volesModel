\title{Simulates from the voles models of Fasiolo and Wood (2015).}
\usage{
volesSimulator(param, nsim, nObs, extraArgs = NULL, model = "full",
  nBurn = 12 * 10, nSteps = 10, T0 = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{param}{If model == "full" it must be a vector of length 9 or a matrix of size nsim by 9, if model == "standard"
it must be a vector of length 7 or a matrix of size nsim by 7.
If param is a vector each of the nsim simulations will use the same parameters, if it's a matrix the i-th simulation
will use the i-th row of param as parameters.}

\item{nsim}{Number of simulations from the model.}

\item{nObs}{Length of each simulated time series in months.}

\item{extraArgs}{Only needed for compatibility with the "synlik" package.}

\item{model}{If model == "full" the function will simulate from the full model described in eq. 2 of Turchin and Ellner (2000),
model == "standard" the function will simulate from the full model described in eq. 6 of Turchin and Ellner (2000).}

\item{nBurn}{Number of initial steps to be discarded before saving the following nObs steps.}

\item{nSteps}{Number of finite differences steps between 2 observations (an interval which corresponds to a month).}

\item{...}{Only needed for compatibility with the "synlik" package.}
}
\value{
A list where [[""voles"]] and [["weasels"]] are two matrices of size nsim by nObs where each row is a trajectory
        simulated from the model.
